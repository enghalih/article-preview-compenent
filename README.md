### What I learned

Working on this project helped me strengthen my understanding of core frontend concepts, especially layout and styling fundamentals. I practiced choosing between CSS Grid and Flexbox based on layout needs, and learned how modern CSS utilities can simplify alignment and positioning.

I also improved my debugging skills by inspecting pseudo-elements in browser developer tools, understanding why they sometimes do not appear, and identifying common causes such as missing content, incorrect positioning, or stacking context issues.

Additionally, this project reinforced the importance of using valid CSS color formats and following best practices to avoid silent styling errors.
